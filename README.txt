Exomoon Candidates Catalogue
--------------------------

This document contains a catalogue of **exomoon candidates** compiled from multiple scientific articles. It gathers key observational and inferred parameters for each candidate, including the properties of the moon, host planet, and host star, as well as uncertainties and references to the original sources.

The catalogue is intended to support statistical analysis of exomoon properties, detection limits, and stability criteria, and may be useful for follow-up studies, mission planning, or comparative studies with the Solar System.

Each row corresponds to a reported exomoon candidate or system, and each column is described below:
